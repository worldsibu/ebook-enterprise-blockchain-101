# Introduction #

This book aims to take you through a learning journey from a 0 previous knowledge state to a comprehensive understanding of blockchain uses in the enterprise and a hands-on initial expertise level.

Even if the blockchain technology has been around for more than 10 years and in the case of enterprise frameworks for more than 4 years, specialized engineers are still required to build smart contract systems. That's an uncommon situation compared to other big technological trends such as mobile, IoT, and AI. Take the mobile industry as an example, just 5 years (October 22, 2013) after Apple launched its App Store, one million apps had been created already, and by the same year, Ionic was launched by Drifty Co enabling thousands of developers to create mobile apps without hard-core mobile knowledge.

The main reason why WorldSibu exists is to make the blockchain technology more accessible to developers around the world. We believe in the potential of blockchain/DLT (distributed ledger technology) to create a new way for enterprises to communicate and achieve real digitalization.

## What is a blockchain ##

Technical descriptions of what the blockchain technology is are all around the internet, explaining the different approaches to linking transactions, achieving consensus, and other technical details. But in this book, we are going to focus on the value of the technology, aside from how each framework solves the common challenges.

A blockchain/DLT network is an implementation of a blockchain framework that allows multiple parties to exchange data according to some predefined rules (smart contracts).

There are a lot of blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, EOS, and others, as well as there are a lot of blockchain frameworks such as Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Sawtooth, and Quorum.

A blockchain is not a replacement 

Blockchain framework

## Why blockchain in the enterprise ##

There are three main trends that lead us to think that blockchain in the enterprise is the potential solution to help us achieve the digital world we expect. In most

It's expensive therefore just solves certian challenges

Trends and reasons

Myths

### How is it different from a public network ###

This book is not going to get into one of the other
just high light differences and why from our POV b2b permissioned makes sense
not sooo transfor
